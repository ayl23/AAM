      <h1>Drug delivery</h1>
        <h2>Main topics</h2>
        <p>The study of the mechanisms that control drug delivery in porous systems presents a critical importance in medicine,
          where nanotechnology has a fundamental impact to revolutionise cancer diagnosis and therapy. Indeed, a fundamental,
          yet unresolved, problem in many therapies including cancer treatment resides in the fact that many routinely used drugs
          present high-level concentration within the first minutes followed by low-levels in the next hours. Firstly, drugs suffer
          non-specific distribution through healthy and tumour cells. Secondly, to reach a tumour cell, drugs need to go across
          several barriers in the body that generally try to protect healthy cells from external aggression. Nowadays,
          the efficient delivery of a drug to a designated cell is a challenging bioengineering problem, which benefits extend
          not only to cancer treatment but also to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.</p>
        <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), one of the most exciting developments in recent porous materials science,
          have been proposed recently for drug delivery. One of their advantages over traditional porous materials is
          the possibility to tune their properties by choosing their building units, and therefore controlling the release
          of the therapeutic agent. Moreover, they can be functionalised with further molecules with high affinity to target
          tumour cells. Non- toxic and biodegradable nanoMOFs are suitable for the transport and controlled delivery of a
          large number of therapeutic agents, showing extremely high drug capacity and very long release time.</p>
