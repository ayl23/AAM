      <h1>MOF synthesis</h1>
      <h2>Main topics</h2>
      <p>The attention on adsorptive porous materials has turned in the last years to metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),
        one of the most exciting developments in recent porous-materials science. MOFs present potential applications in many areas,
        including several promising uses in biomedical and industrial areas of gas separation and storage.
        In MOFs, the self-assembly of metal ions or clusters, which act as coordination centres, linked together
        by a variety of polyatomic organic bridging ligands, results in tailored nanoporous host materials with
        a vast structural diversity. The most striking advantage of MOFs over more traditional porous materials,
        such as zeolites or activated carbons, is the possibility to tune the host / guest interaction by choosing
        the appropriate building blocks and topologies.</p>
