      <h1>Gas Adsorption and Storage</h1>
        <h2>Main topics</h2>
        <p>Predictions on climate change and the threat of global warming have stimulated scientific research into finding means
          of decreasing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Much attention has focused on capturing CO2 from carbon-based power
          stations where large quantities of CO2 are emitted in flue-gas streams. Economical, post-combustion CO2 capture and
          storage (CCS) from power-plant flue gas is one of the most important problems in carbon capture. While pre-combustion
          strategies are promising, they do not address the large installed base of power plants in the United Kingdom and other
          developed countries. Adsorption-based separations using membranes and pressure-swing adsorption on a porous
          material represent a viable and cost-effective alternative to current absorption amine-based technologies
          because of the milder operating conditions and lower energy demand involved. However, the use of adsorption
          process for CCS is dependent on identifying adsorbents with high selectivity and capacity.</p>
