      <h1>Our Research</h1>
        <p>Our research concerns the study of the molecular mechanisms that control adsorption processes in porous materials.
          We are particularly interested in drug delivery systems, where nanotechnology has a fundamental impact to revolutionise cancer
          diagnosis and therapy. We are also interested in the use of novel porous materials for the necessary shift from today’s
          fossil-based energy economy to a more sustainable economy based on hydrogen and renewable energy,
          linked to the carbon capture to mitigate the effects of global warming.
          Our objective is to evaluate new strategies in the study of adsorption processes, the study and design
          of new porous materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and to develop new methods in the prediction of their performance.</p>
        <p>In our work, we combine molecular simulation techniques such as grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and molecular
          dynamics (MD) simulations to study adsorption and diffusion phenomena with experimental techniques
          that include gas adsorption, confocal microscopy, cell cultures, calorimetry, neutron and X-Ray diffraction and small-angle X-Ray scattering.</p>

        <h2><a href="./mof.html">MOF synthesis</a></h2>
          <p>The attention on adsorptive porous materials has turned in the last years to metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),
            one of the most exciting developments in recent porous-materials science. MOFs present potential applications in many areas,
            including several promising uses in biomedical and industrial areas of gas separation and storage.
            In MOFs, the self-assembly of metal ions or clusters, which act as coordination centres, linked together
            by a variety of polyatomic organic bridging ligands, results in tailored nanoporous host materials with
            a vast structural diversity. The most striking advantage of MOFs over more traditional porous materials,
            such as zeolites or activated carbons, is the possibility to tune the host / guest interaction by choosing
            the appropriate building blocks and topologies.</p>

        <h2><a href="./gas.html">Gas Adsorption and Storage</a></h2>
          <p>Predictions on climate change and the threat of global warming have stimulated scientific research into finding means
            of decreasing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Much attention has focused on capturing CO2 from carbon-based power
            stations where large quantities of CO2 are emitted in flue-gas streams. Economical, post-combustion CO2 capture and
            storage (CCS) from power-plant flue gas is one of the most important problems in carbon capture. While pre-combustion
            strategies are promising, they do not address the large installed base of power plants in the United Kingdom and other
            developed countries. Adsorption-based separations using membranes and pressure-swing adsorption on a porous
            material represent a viable and cost-effective alternative to current absorption amine-based technologies
            because of the milder operating conditions and lower energy demand involved. However, the use of adsorption
            process for CCS is dependent on identifying adsorbents with high selectivity and capacity.</p>

        <h2><a href="./drug.html">Drug Delivery</a></h2>
          <p>The study of the mechanisms that control drug delivery in porous systems presents a critical importance in medicine,
            where nanotechnology has a fundamental impact to revolutionise cancer diagnosis and therapy. Indeed, a fundamental,
            yet unresolved, problem in many therapies including cancer treatment resides in the fact that many routinely used drugs
            present high-level concentration within the first minutes followed by low-levels in the next hours. Firstly, drugs suffer
            non-specific distribution through healthy and tumour cells. Secondly, to reach a tumour cell, drugs need to go across
            several barriers in the body that generally try to protect healthy cells from external aggression. Nowadays,
            the efficient delivery of a drug to a designated cell is a challenging bioengineering problem, which benefits extend
            not only to cancer treatment but also to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.</p>
          <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), one of the most exciting developments in recent porous materials science,
            have been proposed recently for drug delivery. One of their advantages over traditional porous materials is
            the possibility to tune their properties by choosing their building units, and therefore controlling the release
            of the therapeutic agent. Moreover, they can be functionalised with further molecules with high affinity to target
            tumour cells. Non- toxic and biodegradable nanoMOFs are suitable for the transport and controlled delivery of a
            large number of therapeutic agents, showing extremely high drug capacity and very long release time.</p>

        <h2><a href="./simulations.html">Simulations</a></h2>
          <p>The combination of molecular simulation and experiments presents several benefits. Firstly, the use of molecular
            simulation provides a crucial link between adsorption phenomena at the molecular level and macroscopic measures
            of adsorption performance, providing a detailed picture that is not easily accessible from experimental methods.
            On the other hand, experimental characterisation is crucial for a final application, where the quality of the experimental
            solid depends strongly on the synthesis and processing of the sample, which can lead to defects in the crystal.
            The experimental measurements combined with molecular simulations serve several high interest purposes: i) the validation of
            the molecular simulation approach under realistic conditions and ii) additional characterisation of the real
            adsorbent structure.</p>
